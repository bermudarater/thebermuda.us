        <h2>Sell Policies Without an Agent 24/7</h2>
        <p>How can I sell policies without an agent 24/7: Bermuda Agentic AI enables fully automated policy sales around the clock. When leads come in from sources like Smart Financial or Quote Wizard, even at 2 AM on a Sunday, our AI automatically receives the lead, generates real-time quotes, and if your carriers offer "Buy Now" options, it can bind the policy and process payment - all without any human intervention. This means customers can get quoted, purchase coverage, and receive their policy documents instantly, any time of day or night. You wake up to completed sales. Less labor, more revenue, and your agency never sleeps.</p>
